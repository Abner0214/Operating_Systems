# NSYSU CSE Operating Systems Course Homework

This repository contains homework assignments for the Operating Systems course at National Sun Yat-sen University (NSYSU) for the Spring 2023 semester. Each assignment focuses on various fundamental and advanced concepts in Operating Systems, including kernel recompilation, shell programming, process synchronization, memory management, and file systems.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into five main folders, each corresponding to a specific homework assignment:

- `HW1` - Kernel Recompilation and Basic Shell Implementation
- `HW2` - Process Synchronization using Pthreads
- `HW3` - Memory Management Techniques and Algorithms
- `HW4` - Page Replacement Algorithms
- `HW5` - File Systems and Virtual Memory

Each folder contains the assignment description, source code, Makefile, and any additional resources required to complete the homework.

## HW1: Kernel Recompilation and Shell Implementation

### Objectives:
1. Install and recompile the Linux kernel with a custom version number.
2. Implement a basic shell capable of single-process commands, two-process pipelines, I/O redirection, and background execution.

### Requirements:
- Linux environment for development and testing.
- Basic understanding of shell scripting and C programming for kernel modification.

## HW2: Process Synchronization

### Objectives:
1. Understand the use of Pthreads for process synchronization.
2. Simulate the dining philosophers problem to resolve race conditions.

### Requirements:
- Proficiency in C or C++ programming.
- Familiarity with Pthreads and synchronization mechanisms.

## HW3: Memory Management

### Objectives:
1. Explore memory-mapped I/O and Direct Memory Access (DMA).
2. Study various CPU scheduling algorithms and their impact on process performance.

### Requirements:
- Understanding of memory management concepts in operating systems.
- Ability to analyze and compare scheduling algorithms.

## HW4: Page Replacement Algorithms

### Objectives:
1. Understand and implement various page replacement algorithms.
2. Analyze the efficiency of different algorithms under various conditions.

### Requirements:
- Knowledge of virtual memory and paging.
- Proficiency in C or C++ for algorithm implementation.

## HW5: File Systems and Virtual Memory

### Objectives:
1. Distinguish between hard links and symbolic links.
2. Understand the principles of virtual memory and paging.
3. Implement a program to demonstrate memory-mapped file access.

### Requirements:
- Familiarity with file system concepts and operations.
- Proficiency in C or C++ for programming projects.

## Compilation

Each folder contains a Makefile to compile the programs. To compile, navigate to the specific homework directory and run:

`make clean dep all`
